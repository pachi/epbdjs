/* ENERGYCALCULATIONS - Implementation of the ISO EN 52000-1 standard

  Energy performance of buildings - Overarching EPB assessment - General framework and procedures

  This implementation has used the following assumptions:
  - weighting factors are constant for all timesteps
  - no priority is set for energy production (average step A weighting factor f_we_el_stepA)
  - all on-site produced energy from non cogeneration sources is considered as delivered
  - the load matching factor is constant and equal to 1.0
